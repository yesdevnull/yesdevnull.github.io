So you've got OS X Mavericks and you want a server.  Mavericks Server has brought a number of changes to the Server side of OS X.  Notable changes include Xcode Server, a continuous integration service for teams of developers for Xcode, SMB2 for file sharing, Caching Server for caching of iOS content and speedy delivery, and Profile Manager with changes including distribution of apps and books purchased from the App Store volume licensing program.
