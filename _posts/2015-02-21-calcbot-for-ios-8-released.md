The best calculator for iOS has been updated for iOS 8. [Calcbot](http://tapbots.com/software/calcbot/), by Tapbots, has been given a fantastic re-design and Convertbot has been merged into Calcbot (requires a small In-App Purchase.) As much as I miss the awesome skeuomorphic design of the original Tapbots style, the new design is very clean and fluid. Now I just wish I could override the Control Center shortcut to open in Calcbot now, rather than the standard Calculator app.
