I got an email this morning from Bryzone’s PR team with a link to his debut EP. Normally, when I get a promotional email I tend to ignore them, but with anything music related I got curious. I jumped over to his [SoundCloud set page](https://soundcloud.com/soulvent-records/sets/bryzone-trial-run-ft-jenny) and now I can’t stop listening to it.

I really enjoy Bryzone’s style, it feels similar to Zero T in that it’s almost a blend of chill out/lounge vibes but has the tempo and beats of good old Drum and Bass. The first track, **Trial Run**, has a great piano melody and Jenny Mayhem’s voice is a killer. I wouldn’t be surprised if she finds herself up there with highly talented DnB vocalists like Diane Charlemagne or Jenna G within a year or two. The second track, **Stargaze**, has got a real deep house feel – it reminds me of the Jaytech tracks you’d hear on the Anjunadeep label, but instead it also has the backing of a strong DnB groove. Overall, I’m really impressed with his music and I look forward to seeing more of Bryzone in the future.

If you’d like to see more of Bryzone, check out [the press release](http://thesixthdegree.net/press/bryzone/) or head over to [the SoundCloud EP set page](https://soundcloud.com/soulvent-records/sets/bryzone-trial-run-ft-jenny) to give it a listen.

I hope to see Bryzone play in Perth, Australia some day because I will definitely be there to watch him groove.

<small>**Update:** for full disclosures sake, since posting this article I did receive a free copy of the EP from Bryzone’s PR team. Cheers!</small>
