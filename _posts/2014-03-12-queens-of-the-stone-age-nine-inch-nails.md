Yesterday night I saw Queens of the Stone Age and Nine Inch Nails at Perth Arena in Perth, Western Australia. Last night was the first time I’ve seen either band live, and they were both fantastic! If you, the reader, ever get the opportunity to see either band in concert, I highly recommend it.

I’ve listened to Nine Inch Nails for a few years and never really saw myself as being able to dance along to their music because, let’s be honest, a fair bit of Trent’s music is very mellow and not exactly dance material. Boy was I wrong — I danced the night away.

The warmup act, Brody Dalle, was pretty good. I’ve never heard her stuff before, but I will definitely be checking her out on Spotify.

# Highlights
While the concert was excellent and I loved every song that was played, I do have a favourite song for each set, check ‘em out below:

- Queens of the Stone Age: A Song for the Dead &middot; Runner Up: Little Sister
- Nine Inch Nails: Head Like A Hole &middot; Runner Up: March of the Pigs

# Lowlights
- Typical stupid drunk idiot antics like pushing and fighting
- So many people smoking weed in the arena, I walked out at the end of the night stinking of smoke and pot
