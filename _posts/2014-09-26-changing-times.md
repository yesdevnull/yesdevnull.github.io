These last few months have seen many changes happen in my life. I’ve moved away from the Apple Systems Engineer role/world and transitioned into a Web Developer role here in Perth. I’ve moved state, proposed to my girlfriend (now fiancée), and bought a house (we’re also getting a dog).

This year saw me launch a fun project that I had been working on for a few months, a database for the best podcast in the world, [Stop Podcasting Yourself](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/stop-podcasting-yourself). The website, [SpyDB](http://spydb.me/), is built on [Laravel](http://laravel.com/), my favourite PHP framework. This is my biggest project I’ve used Laravel on, and it was a blast to see just how easy it was to make something quite functional with relatively little past experience in Laravel.

The OS X Mavericks Server articles I wrote last year have continued to be a huge hit, but unfortunately there will be no OS X Server tutorials this year. I had planned (and started writing) a OS X 10.10 Yosemite Server eBook that was going to be distributed through Leanpub, but I’m just not able to dedicate time to writing about OS X Server, especially with paying customers. It wouldn’t be fair on the buyers of an incomplete book to wait months for a potentially completed book. I’m just not that kind of guy.

The content of this website will likely change to a more Web Developer aspect, but I’m still playing around with OS X Server so no doubt I’ll blog about some issues I come across.

Many thanks for reading, I hope you have a good rest of your day.
