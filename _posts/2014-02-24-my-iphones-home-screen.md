    name: 1Password
    rating: 5
    website: "https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios"
    version: 4.3.2
    pros: great design, super secure
    cons: no iOS 7 design (yep, that's now a con)

        - "It seems like every day another website or company's user database is getting exposed. Shockingly, many of them have little to no password obfuscation so hackers have been able to easily pull tens, hundreds, thousands and millions of passwords. 1Password gives you an easy way to generate a complex password, unique for every website or service."
        - "Not only does 1Password generate passwords, but it can also keep other important information secure, for example: credit cards and passport details. You can even store other cards you may have in your wallet, or notes you don't want to be read by others."
        - "1Password was one of the first apps I ever bought when I got my MacBook Pro in 2009 and I've been using it constantly ever since. The ability to have my passwords synced on my Mac, iPhone and iPad all at once gives me an incredible amount of freedom so I can do anything secure-related on the go. One other reason I love 1Password, and the AgileBits team is that they stay on top of password decryption trends. Their [cryptography blog](http://blog.agilebits.com/tag/cryptography_/) is definitely worth a read."

    name: Analytiks
    rating: 5
    website: "http://analytiksapp.com/"
    version: 3.0.7
    pros: great looking graphs and statistics
    cons: limited range of graphs, not all UI elements entirely obvious
    description:
        - "I discovered Analytiks only recently, and it’s hands down the best looking Google Analytics app for iOS that I’ve seen. I really like the percentage increase/decrease statistics it shows each day."
        - "I’ve even found their support to be phenomenal, I emailed them about an issue and got a personal reply in **3 minutes**. Issue fixed and I was very satisfied."
        - "One other thing that is really fantastic about this app is that it fully supports Google’s OAuth 2.0 2-step authentication, which is a big plus in my book. It even has a different colour scheme depending on the colour of your iPhone!"

    name: Instacast
    website: "http://vemedio.com/products/instacast"
    version: 4.2
    rating: 5
    pros: great design, easy to use
    cons: a few minor UI annoyances
    description:
        - "A while ago I got really sick of the iOS podcasts implementation (this was when Podcasts were part of the Music.app) so I went to find an alternative. I didn’t really like the look of Downcast (at the time) so Instacast seemed like the perfect replacement, with better features (than the iOS default alternative). Enter Instacast."
        - "Two years later, I still love using Instacast. When iOS 7 landed it was quick to be updated with a new design, which I do like. They’re also one of the only iOS podcast apps that has a Mac companion — and they sync!"
        - "I listen to podcasts every night when I head to bed, so it’s fair to say I’ve used it every night for the past two years. I also have a thing for orange, so the icon is really attractive to me."

My iPhone is very important to me. I use it for hours on end each day, for work and for leisure, so I need the best apps upfront so I can access them quickly.

First off, my wallpaper of choice is a photo of San Francisco that I saw on MG Siegler’s blog, [parislemon](http://parislemon.com/). Although I’ve never been to San Fran, I love the photo so I put it as my wallpaper. If you like the photo, you can [check it out here](http://parislemon.com/post/61893365955/omnivector-san-francisco-treat-ios-7-parallax).
