For a very, very long time I’ve put off accepting donations to the site, but with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) accepting me into their Australian beta, I’ve decided to sign up and see how it goes.

If any of my articles have helped you out and if you’ve got some coin to spare, help a fellow dev/sysadmin out and donate a caffeinated drink or two! Many thanks.
