Finally, after many months of development and testing, my buddy [Jedda](http://jedda.me) has released his excellent backup script called Counterpart.  The utility is written in Bash, and is a neat wrapper for rsync 3 to perform an easy backup of OS X.

While Time Machine backups are excellent, especially since OS X Server requires it to do proper backups, there's nothing better than a bootable clone just in case your system goes down during crunch-time.  There's nothing worse than having a drive fail, only to find it's going to be another few hours before your system will be live again.  That's where Counterpart comes in.

Check out the [article on his blog](http://jedda.me/2013/12/introducing-counterpart/), or go [straight to the code](https://github.com/jedda/Counterpart) if you're that way inclined.

And the best part?  It's _freeeee_.
